Minimization of solvent
 &cntrl
  imin = 1, 	 ! Minimization on
  ntmin=1,  	 ! Method of minimization, 1 uses steepest gradient then conjugate gradient
  maxcyc = 1000,  ! How many cycles to run
  ncyc = 30,     ! How many cycles at steepest gradient
  irest = 1,     ! Restart simulation from previous .rst7 file
  ntx = 5,  	 ! Read coordinates and velocities from rst7 coordinate file
  ntwe = 0,  	 ! No mden files are switten
  ntwr = 500, 	 ! Every ntwr steps the restart file will be written
  ntwx = 0,  	 ! No .crd trajectory file written, not applicable for minimization
  ntpr = 50, 	 ! Print to output file every N cycles
  ntc = 2,  	 ! Bonds involving H are constrained
  ntf = 2,  	 ! Bonds involving H are omitted from force evaluation
  ntb = 1,  	 ! There is constant volume
  ntp = 0,  	 ! There is pressure scaling
  cut = 8.0,    ! Nonbonded cutoff distance in Angstroms
  ntr=1,  	 ! Turn restrainmask on
  restraintmask = '@CA,N,C',   ! Set positional restraints on backbone atoms
  restraint_wt = 5, ! Set strong positional restraint in kcal/mol*Ang^-2
  ntxo=2,  	 ! Output final coordinates in recommended NetCDF file format
