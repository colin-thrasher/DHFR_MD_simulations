Minimization of solvent
 &cntrl
  imin = 1,  ! Minimization on
  ntmin=1,   ! Method of minimization, 1 uses steepest gradient then conjugate gradient
  maxcyc = 1000,   ! How many cycles to run
  ncyc = 50,   ! How many cycles at steepest gradient
  ntx = 1,   ! Read coordinates but NOT velocities from rst7 coordinate file
  ntwe = 0,   ! No mden files are switten
  irest=0,   ! Run a new simulation, i.e. no restart
  ntwr = 500,   ! Every ntwr steps the restart file will be written
  ntwx = 0,   ! No .crd trajectory file written, not applicable for minimization
  ntpr = 5,   ! Print to output file every N cycles
  ntc = 2,   ! Bonds involving H are constrained
  ntf = 2,   ! Bonds involving H are omitted from force evaluation
  ntb = 1,   ! There is constant volume
  ntp = 0,   ! There is pressure scaling
  cut = 10.0,   ! Nonbonded cutoff distance in Angstroms
  ntr=1,   ! Turn restrainmask on
  restraintmask = ':1-186',   ! Set positional restraints on all protein atoms
  restraint_wt = 100,   ! Set strong positional restraint
  ntxo=2,   ! Output final coordinates in recommended NetCDF file format
